# NodeJS-Backend

I'm Learning to create backend of a Web Application using NodeJS.

So Far, I've learnt about creating -
1. A simple web server using Express
2. Simple Routes
3. making use of Nodemon
4. difference between dev-dependency and production-dependency
5. Serving static files
6. utilising simple templating engines
7. parsing response bodies 
8. HTTP Status Codes and what they mean
9. Route filters
10. funcioning of NodeJS by using Event Loops
